# Home Autimation
## Abstract
This project is a combination of Android mobile technology and embedded system. User cancontrol Home appliances using Android mobile. An application should be installed on user’s Android mobile handset to control various home appliances. Wireless controlling technique used in this project is Bluetooth technology. The microcontroller used is an Arduino uno board.

## The objectives of this project include: 
* construction of a wireless home automation system controlled by a android Smartphone 
* implementation of cost effective and efficient system. 
* designing  a user friendly and a safe system to control home appliances 
* aid the elderly and handicapped users.

## Components Needed:
  * Arduiuno Uno
  * Bread  Board. 
  * Android phone. 
  * Bluetooth module (RN-42). 
  * Android application. (to control the Arduino via Bluetooth). 
  * Smoke detector 
  * Temperature  sensor  
  * Buzzer 
  * Motion Sensor 
  * Jumping Wires. 
  * Relays Module. 
  * LED lights. 
  * CPU Fan.
  
 ## System Design 
 
There are two types of communication involved in this project: wired and wireless communication. The communication between the Bluetooth module, or RN-42, and the Android based mobile phone will help connect to the controller wirelessly. In contrast, wired communication is the communication between the controller and the appliances. 

## Getting started
### Appliance Part
```
First of all collect all the above mentioned components and make sure everything is wroking by conducting individual testing.
Then note down the password of buletooth module (it is usually 0000 or 1234).
