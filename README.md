# Home Autimation
## Abstract
This project is a combination of Android mobile technology and embedded system. User cancontrol Home appliances using Android mobile. An application should be installed on userâ€™s Android mobile handset to control various home appliances. Wireless controlling technique used in this project is Bluetooth technology. The microcontroller used is an Arduino uno board.

## The objectives of this project include: 
* construction of a wireless home automation system controlled by a android Smartphone 
* implementation of cost effective and efficient system. 
* designing  a user friendly and a safe system to control home appliances 
* aid the elderly and handicapped users.

## Components Needed:
  * Arduiuno Uno
  * Bread  Board. 
  * Android phone. 
  * Bluetooth module (RN-42). 
  * Android application. (to control the Arduino via Bluetooth). 
  * Smoke detector 
  * Temperature  sensor  
  * Buzzer 
  * Motion Sensor 
  * Jumping Wires. 
  * Relays Module. 
  * LED lights. 
  * CPU Fan.
  
 ## System Design 
 
There are two types of communication involved in this project: wired and wireless communication. The communication between the Bluetooth module, or RN-42, and the Android based mobile phone will help connect to the controller wirelessly. In contrast, wired communication is the communication between the controller and the appliances.
